#ToDo
If there is enough interest in the project, we would like to add the following features:
<ul>
<li>
 Add other major IR protocols. At least the once supported by IRRemote Arduino Library 
</li>
<li>
Integrate Irdb.tk api so that remotes can be add to the app during the setup. This would require internet connection only during setup. 
</li>

<li>
RemoteMaker: Add app/firmware feature to create remotes that are not available in the database.
</li>

</ul>

If you've anyother suggestions that could be helpful, please raise on issue here on the repo.
